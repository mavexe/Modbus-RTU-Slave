# FreeModbus-Based Modbus Implementation
 ## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Modbus protocol using the FreeModbus library. Modbus is a serial communication protocol widely used in industrial automation for connecting electronic devices. FreeModbus is an open-source implementation of the Modbus protocol stack, designed to be easy to use and integrate into various platforms.

## Features
Modbus RTU/TCP Support: Implements both the Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP modes.

 Easy Integration: Designed to be easily integrated into your embedded systems.

Customizable: Configurable to meet specific application requirements.

## Prerequisites
Development Environment: Ensure you have a suitable development environment set up for your target platform (e.g., Keil, IAR, GCC).

Target Hardware: Compatible with any hardware that supports serial communication (UART for RTU, Ethernet for TCP).

FreeModbus Library: The FreeModbus library must be available in your project.

## Installation
Clone the Repository:

onfigure FreeModbus:

Include the FreeModbus library in your project.

Configure the Modbus settings (baud rate, data bits, parity, etc.) according to your hardware setup.

Build the Project:

Compile the project using your development environment.

Ensure all dependencies are correctly linked.

Flash the Firmware:

Flash the compiled firmware onto your target hardware.

## Usage
Modbus RTU: Connect your device to a Modbus master using a serial connection.

Modbus TCP: Connect your device to a Modbus master using an Ethernet connection.

Testing: Use a Modbus testing tool (like Modbus Poll or ModScan) to communicate with your device and verify functionality.
